If the quota chosen for betting was 3.0 and the amount the user bet was of $10, and “Team A” wins the football match, that user will receive $30 ($20 + $10=$30). If “Team A” loses the user will lose the $10 he/she bet. </p>

<p>Ex: Lay Bet – If there is a football match wherein “Team A” and “Team B” are playing against each other and the user believes that “Team A” will lose, he/she should place a Lay bet on “Team A”. If this Lay bet is matched and the football match results in a draw or “Team A” loses the football match the user will be entitled to receive his/her winnings from the bet placed. If the quota for betting was 3.0 and the amount the user bet was of $10, the sum will be calculated as following (3.0 x $10) - $10 = $20 in the public market. This means that the users who placed a Lay bet (ie: Layers) will be matched with the users who placed a Back bet (ie: Backers), $10 on 3.0 quota. </p>

<p>When a Competition Event is finished all matched bets will be automatically calculated and winners will receive their winnings. The amount bet of any bet that was not matched will be returned to the user. </p>

<p>A User may not change the quota of his bet once the Competition Event has started. </p>

<p><b>5.3 Bet Against Friends</b></p>

<p>Users can send bets to each other. Ex: “User 1” and “User 2”can send bet requests to each other. In order to be able to bet against other Users must be “Friends” on the website. The bet between “User 1” and “User 2” will not be available in the public market. </p>

<p><b>5.4 Winner</b></p>

<p>The winner of a competition is the person who is supposed to be the winner immediately after the event (ex: Formula 1 – victory ceremony). Any subsequent changes in the ranking (ex: “armchair decisions”) will have no effect on the winners. In football the result after ninety (90) minutes (regular time) and in ice hockey the result after sixty (60) minutes (regular time) is relevant. Any extra time, penalty shootout, etc. will have no impact on the winnings, with the exception of special bets offered, which are marked accordingly. </p>

<p>In American sports (NFL, College Football, NHL, NBA, NBL) the score including overtime, if any, is relevant for rating purposes. If a team wins exactly by the points by which it lagged behind first (point spreads) and, thus, there is no winner, the stakes will be refunded. If X Odds (= bet on tie ) are offered in World Championships, Olympic Games or other competitions, the result after the official time is relevant. </p>

<p><b>5.5 Exceptional Circumstances</b></p>

<p>If a betting event is cancelled, abandoned, or ends without official score or is not held for any other reasons, the stake will be refunded. A “walk over” during a tennis match, by which the opponent wins automatically, is excluded from this rule. If at the time the event is cancelled an alternative time has already been fixed for the relevant betting event and if it will restart during the next calendar day, the bet will stand. Exceptions: if a tennis match is postponed the bet will stand, provided that the match is played in the course of the same tournament. The same applies where a betting event is held in the course of a World Championship or European Championship or Olympic Games. All time stated refer to Central European Time (CET). </p>

<p>If one or more betting events in a combination bet is (are) cancelled or abandoned or is (are) not held for other reasons and if they are not run by the end of the second calendar day following the event, such betting event (s) will be rated at odds of 1.00. If all events in a combination bet are cancelled, abandoned or not held during the next calendar day for any other reasons, the stake will be refunded. If a bet in which several betting events are combined is placed only after one or several of those events have started, such betting event(s) will be rated at odds 1.00. However, this does not apply to bets which due to their nature are expressly offered, by the Operator, or the creator of the Competition after the event has started (eg: long-term bets, live bets, etc…). This also applies to betting events that have been erroneously listed in the wrong order on the betting program (list of odds), but not in the case of a home team waiving its right to play in its own stadium or arena, if the home team’s arena/stadium is temporarily closed or if the betting event is held at a neutral site. </p>

<p>In the event of system failure a Competition may be cancelled. In case of a system failure in the course of the placing of a Bet, the Bet shall be deemed as accepted and concluded if it is recorded in the system of the Operator. A Bet is valid only once the Operator has confirmed acceptance from &lt;&lt;email in user’s account, &gt;&gt; </p>

<p>The Operator reserves the right to withhold payment of a bet and to declare bets on an event null and void if the Operator has evidence that the integrity of the event has been called into question, the bets placed have been manipulated, match rigging has taken place, or any sort of abuse is detected. Evidence of abuse will be based on the size/volume/number or pattern of bets placed in a Competition and/or if a decision has been given by a relevant governing body of the event in question. The Operator reserves the right to terminate events in any other circumstance the Operator may deem fit to do so. </p>
