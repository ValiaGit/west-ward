    There are few steps to do before you can make Bets:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Register Account from <a href="#" class="blue" onclick="Registration.openDialog();return false;">here</a></li>
    <li>Confirm Email address</li>
    <li>Deposit Money with Ecopayz</li>
    <li>Choose desired Event and Outcome</li>
    <li>Make bet on Back(For) or Lay(Against) for desired outcome</li>
</ul>

<p>
    After you make bet, it's then part of betting exchange system and is available for other users to bet against.
    <br/>
    If no one will bet against your bet, and bet stays unmatched after event is finished, your money will be deposited back on your account with not cut commission.
    <br />
    Your bets can be match partly or fully. Unmatched amounts are automatically deposited on users account after event is finished.
    <br/>
    You can cancel unmatched amount any time.
    <br/>
    If you make Lay bet and win you are charged with 3% commission from your profit. If you make Back bet and win you will be charged with 5% from your profit.
